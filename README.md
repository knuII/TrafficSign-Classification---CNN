# TrafficSign-Classification---CNN
Traffic signs classification is the process of identifying which class a traffic sign belongs to.

In a self-driving car, passengers can rely entirely on the vehicle during their journey. However, to reach autonomy level 5, the vehicle must understand and obey all traffic rules. 

In the world of artificial intelligence and technological advances, many researchers and big companies such as Tesla, Uber, Google, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Ford, Audi are working on autonomous vehicles and self-driving cars. Therefore, in order to achieve accuracy with this technology, vehicles must be able to interpret traffic signs and make decisions accordingly. 

In this Python project example, we will build a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. With this model, we are able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.
